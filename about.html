        <h1>About Me</h1>
            <p>Hello, I’m Kyler Edwards from Grants Pass, OR. My main interests are music and history. Starting with music, I’ve been playing trumpet for 8 years and guitar for 3. I started trumpet in 6th grade and played in marching and concert bands throughout middle and high school ending with me being the brass section leader in my senior year. Starting in high school I got really into Alternative Rock, especially from the 90s. Influenced by this and using my experience with trumpet I began teaching myself guitar. Also in middle school, I really started getting into history although my dad had been taking me to museums and airshows my whole life. I took a keen interest in World War Two due to several good teachers I decided in high school that I’d like to be a history teacher.</p>  
            <P>Since I didn’t have the best grades in school I knew I wouldn’t get very many scholarships. My family and I also couldn’t afford college outright but weren’t poor enough to get any financial aid. I began looking at my options for college and found the Air National Guard, likely influenced by the years of learning about military history I enlisted and was given a full ride for college. I had to take a gap year for basic training and technical school. In the Air Force, I’m a Materiel Manager, basically, we deal with a huge part of logistics from working with customers to warehouse inventories. In the end, I’ve already got a lot of great experiences and opportunities from joining the Guard.</P>
