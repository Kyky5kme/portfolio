    <h2>Sample Blog Post</h2>
        <h3>Dinosaur Jr.</h3>
            <P>I've recently been listening to a lot of Dinosuar Jr. I bought their album Where You Been on cassette a couple summers ago and was pretty instantly hooked. The guitar solos are the main focus and they deserve to be so. Last spring I listened to You’re Living All Over Me, it's louder and very abrasive. A lot of people think that’s their best album and while I agree that it's really good, Where You Been still takes the cake since it was my introduction to the band. When I went to go see Weezer, Dinosuar Jr. was one of the openers for them along side The Flaming Lips. I was unfortunately running late so I only caught the last few songs but I just heard the other day that they’ll be on tour again. I’m very excited since they’ll be at the same venue I saw Sunny Day Real Estate, The Pioneer Courthouse Square in Portland, Oregon. It’s a really great place since you can get right up to the stage and for pretty cheap too. As always here's my top three songs for the band; 3. Little Fury Things, 2. Feel the Pain, 1. Get Me. Go check 'em out!</P>
